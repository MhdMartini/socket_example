# socket_example
This project is a usage example of the socket library in python. Client and Server classes are created where the server can send data to the client(s).
This application could be implemented in different ways based on each specific need, but this script is a proof of concept and a base socket class for future projects.

WHAT I LEARNED:
This project was a good practice on socket serial communication in python
